<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Information Technology at the George Mason University, advised by [Lei Yang](https://leiyang0416.github.io/) and [Weiwen Jiang](https://jqub.github.io/). My research interest includes *edge machine learning*, *AI4Science on edge*, *effiencient AI*. I have published 10+ conference and journal papers.
I also collaborate with [Youzuo Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/youzuolin044/home) from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Los Alamos National Lab closely.

I graduated from School of Information and Software Engineering,
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China with a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree, advised by Jinyu Zhan.
