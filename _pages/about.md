<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Information Technology (Information Science and Technology) at the George Mason University, advised by [Lei Yang](https://leiyang0416.github.io/) and [Weiwen Jiang](https://jqub.github.io/). My primary research interests focus on  *edge machine learning*, *AI4Science at the edge*, and *efficient AI*. I have authored over 10 papers in leading conferences and journals ([Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=otFECasAAAAJ&hl)).
I also collaborate with [Youzuo Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/youzuolin044/home) from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Los Alamos National Lab closely.

I graduated from School of Information and Software Engineering,
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China with a bachelor‚Äôs degree and a master‚Äôs degree, advised by Jinyu Zhan.
